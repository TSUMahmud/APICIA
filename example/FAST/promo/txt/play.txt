    <string name="long">Find and Launch Applications fast and for free with a small App that needs not a single permission!
Just type in a fraction of the name of the App you want to launch - most of the time 3 chars are enough.

A single click launches the App - a long click gives you 6 Options:
 1. Go to the App details
 2. Customize its Label or create additional entries for the App
 3. Pin the App to top
 4. Hide the App
 5. Open the App as a Notification for FAST access at a later time
 6. Open the App in Google Play

The App is GPLv3 - you can find the source on GitHub: https://github.com/ligi/FAST
